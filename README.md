# _Seven More Languages_ Exercise Results

These are my solutions for the exercises at the end of each section in _[Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks/)_.

This code will not be _great_ nor emblematic of the language it's written in. But, having it available will make it easier for those who _do_ know what they're doing to critique it.

I won't do all the exercises on each day. Probably not even most of them - just the ones that jump out at me.
